                            Artist statement: "As a Digital Artist, Daniel Mendez endeavors to bring together the
                            boundless potential of technology to convey a profound message about the delicate connection
                            between humanity and the environment. Through the medium of Photoshop and Premiere Pro
                            editing, Daniel Mendez seeks to draw attention to the pressing issue of climate change and
                            bring light to the transformative impact human actions have on the world around us.
                            <br><br>

                            conscientious narrator. The artist is the one who brings life to screens, and it goes beyond
                            physical constraints. Each photo and video clip is a deliberate act aimed at showing the
                            story of environmental shifts over time and the effects we as humans have on it.

                            narrative. The intention is not merely aesthetic, but rather a purposeful exploration of the
                            ecological environment that often goes unnoticed in the mundane of everyday life. The
                            digital realm becomes a powerful place for Daniel Mendez’s commitment to raising awareness
                            about the consequences of climate change."
