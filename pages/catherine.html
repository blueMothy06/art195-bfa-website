                            Artist statement: "Making games has always been one of my passions, though it’s one that I
                            don’t get many chances to do. This game was an opportunity to dive back into my hobby and
                            combine many of my interests together. For example, I love anything with an unsettling
                            atmosphere, combined with mystery. That just makes me want to dig deep into the world and
                            find every single secret, making this an experience I wanted to share with others.
                            <br><br>
                            “the door isn’t there” is a love letter to all the indie horror games I’ve ever enjoyed.
                            This project is both a puzzle point-and-click game and a story about a woman named Olivia
                            going through her scattered memories. Many of the locations she visits throughout the game
                            are reminiscent of liminal spaces, places that feel both familiar and strange, embracing the
                            overall uncertainty of the game’s atmosphere. The hand drawn, monochromatic art style only
                            adds to it. The distorted shapes and shaky lines paint an unsettling world because things
                            aren’t what they seem for Olivia.
                            <br><br>
                            The door isn’t there. Nor is it behind you. In fact, does the door actually matter?"

                        <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                            Based in San Francisco, Catherine Luong is an artist whose work focuses on game development
                            and digital illustration. She has always been interested in telling stories from a young
                            age, loving how characters would come to life when she fleshed them out. When she got older,
                            her interest turned to games and she loved the interactivity of them, letting her explore
                            worlds in a new way. This very concept is what inspires her as an artist; Catherine aims to
                            create artwork that pulls viewers into a new world and makes them want to stay to the end.
                            Her stories range from surreal horror to fun, silly projects that aim to get a laugh out of
                            someone, but as long as someone enjoys it, that’s a goal achieved.
