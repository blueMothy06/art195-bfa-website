                            Artist statement: "Anxiety World" is a 3D virtual reality experience that depicts my
                            personal struggle with anxiety, marijuana abuse, and how it affects my worldview. Fun and
                            colorful yet possibly fear-inducing clowns evoke a sense of tension and disquiet. The scene
                            itself takes place in a liminal space made up of unending white sprawl and colored tiles
                            that suggest a sort of false comfort. One of the clowns offers you a blunt. On one hand,
                            marijuana may add to the problem of anxiety. On the other hand, it offers a fun distraction.
                            What do you do? Sometimes I feel trapped in a carnivalesque reality where I'm not sure of
                            the people around me or my path forward. Marijuana serves as a temporary escape and
                            "self-handicap" that allows me to feel there is an understandable reason for the anxiety I
                            face. It also aids a sense of having fun in the face of adversity and the unknowing of
                            anxiety. "Anxiety World" asks the viewer to consider the prevalence of anxiety, marijuana
                            abuse, and the impact it has on people's lives, and for those struggling with these issues
                            to enjoy the ride despite the challenges you may face.
