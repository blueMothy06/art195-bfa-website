                            Artist statement: "Oftentimes people view the monster as an evil thing to destroy, but they
                            fail to learn about its story. Hidetaka Miyazaki, the creator of the video game Dark Souls,
                            has a world filled with such monsters. They are ugly, evil looking, and attack you therefore
                            they must die. This is what most players think, but for the ones who look past their
                            features and take the extra effort to dive deeper into their stories discover the sadness of
                            their tales. They learn that most of these monsters were just trying to survive the curse
                            laid upon them, oftentimes they attack you because they’re protecting the only thing they
                            hold dear to them, and most of them were just innocents caught in the crossfires of some
                            higher authority figure’s greedy war. Learning their story grants players a more virtuous
                            reason to fight. Every creature encountered is now met with pity and every creature slain is
                            met with mercy. Before you fight, think about your enemy. It’s the least you can do.
                            <br> <br>
                            Blackwall is an RPG game where you play as the hero whose duty is to stop the Lich. You are
                            allowed to ignore everything and just speed rush through, but players who take their time to
                            understand the story will have a better experience. Blackwall is meant to teach players that
                            these monsters you must kill were once people. Understand the story, understand the people
                            you are protecting, understand these things before you must kill. In the real world, not
                            every encounter will have a peaceful resolution, but you must not lose your humanity when
                            doing so."

                        <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                            I was born in Manilla, Philippines and raised in San Jose, California. I started my art
                            journey sometime in elementary school in the early 2000’s creating funny comics for my
                            school mates with just a pencil and paper. High school is when I began to pursue a career in
                            art, learning all the fundamentals through my background in animation. However, when I got
                            to college I was convinced to change my career aspirations and started to learn coding. Yet
                            my passion for art and video games lead me back to pursuing my original dream. My thirst to
                            learn everything related to art and video games has broadened my knowledge as a student and
                            a creator. Now with my accumulated knowledge and experience, I plan to create many more
                            projects to entertain everyone.
