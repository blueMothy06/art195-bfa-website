                            Artist statement: "The exploration of AI and AI-generated work initially filled me with
                            terror due to how AI was portrayed and my lack of understanding what artificial intelligence
                            means. My artistic endeavors are usually a blend between traditional and digital mediums and
                            before I came to SJSU I only engaged with traditional mediums like painting. When I was only
                            engaged in traditional mediums and encountering AI art, I was often frustrated and angry at
                            the lack of policy and the seemingly mindless theft or work. The thought of AI transforming
                            years of an artist's work into something that cannot be copyrighted or traced back to its
                            origins within moments was deeply unsettling. I wrestled with feelings of rage and
                            apprehension about the future of artists, concerned about their creations and identities
                            being stripped from their contexts instantaneously.
                            <br><br>
                            However, my perspective shifted as I delved into coding and the history of computer-based
                            art. This exploration, including reading Safita Umoja Noble's "Algorithms of Oppression" and
                            attending classes at SJSU, unveiled the more human aspect of these programs. They embody
                            human traits, which in turn makes them unreliable and at times incredibly stupid. In this
                            project, I aim to navigate my evolving perceptions of AI, acknowledging its intimidating
                            nature and the uncertainty of the future. Yet, there's an individual behind that code, with
                            their thoughts, biases, and 'dumb brain' lurking behind our computer screens. I wanted to
                            explore the feelings of trust I had with AI and what it claims to be or do, but also to
                            recognize the human intentions and guidance behind the machine. My exploration of this
                            concept shifted towards a question that became the main concept of this art work: what does
                            it mean for a machine to claim to be powered by Artificial Intelligence and how much can we
                            trust it?"

                            Vanessa Kim specializes in a multitude of mediums, prominently including acrylic, digital
                            painting, and web-based design. Her creative process is a combination of these mediums,
                            often breathing new life into past ideas and revitalizing them within the digital realm.
                            Drawing inspiration from her everyday experiences and the intricate relationships between
                            science, technology, and art, Vanessa is deeply connected to her craft. Her love for art
                            history's resonance in the ordinary modern world infuses her work with a unique perspective.
                            <br><br>
                            Within her creations, she delves into the intricate web that connects personal narratives,
                            nature's wonders, and contemporary opinions and ideas about technology. Internet culture and
                            the imagery it births often serve as the basis from which her projects evolve, eventually
                            transforming into the more serious stages of her creative process. The people in her life
                            are some of the biggest inspirations to her creative journey. Their support fuels many of
                            her artistic endeavors.
