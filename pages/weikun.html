                            Artist statement: "William Strauss and Neil Howe proposed a cyclical nature of history in
                            their theory,
                            with approximately an 80 to 100-year cycle. This cycle encompasses four distinct historical
                            periods known as "High," "Awakening," "Unraveling," and "Crisis." These four periods gave
                            rise to four different generations: "Prophet," "Nomad," "Hero," and "Artist." The S–H Theory
                            includes some well-known heroes, as well as individuals accused of wrongdoing, celebrated
                            figures, and unsung heroes. Their fates are intertwined, collectively weaving the tapestry
                            of human history.
                            <br><br>
                            While the Strauss and Howe theory is not universally accepted and has faced criticism for a
                            lack of rigorous empirical evidence, it does inspire people with a romantic perspective for
                            reevaluating history. So it also does inspire this art piece.
                            A video composed of four different phases repeats on a human face, the eyes gradually
                            awakening, observing, and then falling back into slumber; the halo of light dances,
                            proliferates, and vanishes once more. Each phase is a fleeting existence, much like the
                            historical figures glimpsed in the video, representing me and you as well. Don't forget, we
                            are also a part of it. We are observing history and also scripting history. In the grand
                            tapestry of history, we, like all ancestors, are momentary yet indispensable. Our destinies
                            interweave and script the story of humanity."

                            Digital Media Artist, Weikun Shen, mainly works on conceptual art, while practicing his
                            skills in Photoshop, After Effects, Premier, and Blender at the same time. Coming from
                            another country with a totally different system, the different identity allows Weikun to
                            observe the world around him with diverse perspectives. While most of Weikun’s works focus
                            on the pure conceptual art, others mainly show the audience the idea of cultural adaptation.
                            Weikun is good at mixing up 2D and 3D environment and create his own ideal world of art.
                            <br><br>
                            In his piece, Weikun Shen prefers to show his personal opinions. He believes that all the
                            controversy comes from misunderstanding, which can only be solved by people talking to each
                            other without hatred and discrimination. So his work is also filled with Idealism and
                            romanticism.
