                            Artist statement: "The House Tour with Tatsuo is a virtual tour allowing the viewers to
                            visit Tatsuo in his lovely home. Every room holds significant meaning to him so be sure to
                            explore thoroughly and enjoy yourself.

                            Tatsuo is a dragon child I created earlier in my life and has been with me ever since. He
                            has featured in my other works from various 2D platformers to sketches in my sketchbook.
                            With this house tour I hope to give Tatsuo an opportunity to meet those around me and the
                            viewer a chance to meet Tatsuo in 3D space. Be nice to him since he does not have too many
                            opportunities to make friends!"

                            Jason Nguyen is an emerging artist and soon to be graduating from San Jose State University
                            with a degree in Digital Media Art. Through his explorations in programs from After Effects
                            to Maya, his work explores the way artwork triggers different emotions and stories from his
                            viewers. His passion for art comes from his love for video games and world building which he
                            also tries to incorporate into his dance performances when he is not working in virtual
                            space. His latest and upcoming show includes his contribution to the SJSU group BFA
                            exhibition, “CTRL-ART-DELETE”.
