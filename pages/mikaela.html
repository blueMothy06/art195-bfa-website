                            Artist statement: "Mikaela Dorch’s digital media artwork, Pixieverse, presents an ethereal
                            panorama of a futuristic fairy world. This virtual reality conceptually portrays the art of
                            transformation: the dream of the second attention. Drawing from ancient spiritual wisdom,
                            the art of transformation shapes dreams into reality within a newly created awareness. From
                            this perspective, Mikaela brings her imagination of a peaceful fantasy dreamscape to life.
                            The future of technology, nature, and spiritual energy embodies Mikaela’s speculative
                            universe.
                            <br><br>
                            Pixieverse’s landscape is composed of natural and artificial elements in creation of
                            boundless energy. The pixies work and play together to restore faith in humanity by using
                            innovative technology. In this contemporary approach, the pixie community updates and
                            notifies humans to not fear the implications of artificial intelligence. Developing
                            technologies can assist but never replace the innate qualities of human complexity: the
                            natural mind, body, spirit, and dream. Pixieverse aims to achieve an ethical balance between
                            natural and artificial emergences in the new media age."

                        <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                            Based in California’s Bay Area region, Mikaela Dorch (she/her) is a digital media artist and
                            creative strategist with a passion for exploring the intersection of art and technology.
                            Starting at an early age, Mikaela was drawn to creating landscape and still-life
                            compositions in pictorial art with materials such as charcoal and acrylic. From adolescence
                            to young adult years, she further expanded her conceptual interests and practice to digital
                            illustration, multimedia production, and graphic design. Currently, she is working with
                            various digital media applications in the realm of visual computer graphics,
                            three-dimensional modeling, and virtual reality world building. Mikaela often blends
                            traditional art techniques with innovative technology to create immersive and engaging
                            works.
                            <br><br>
                            The creative journey of Mikaela continues to evolve through her experimental practice and
                            research in art education. She is committed to pushing boundaries through conceptual
                            projects in conversation of experiences within virtual and natural worlds. For education,
                            Mikaela received an Associate of Arts degree in focus of digital art and graphic design from
                            Las Positas College and will receive a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Digital Media Art
                            from San José State University. In occupation, she works as a freelance digital media
                            artist, creating a variety of projects and commissions for clients. Mikaela’s dynamic
                            journey in digital media art, spanning academia, and freelance work, highlights her
                            unwavering pride in pushing creative borderlines and embracing future technology.
