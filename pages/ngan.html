                            Artist statement: "'Ronias - The Unknown World' is a virtual exhibition of a fantasy world
                            concept design. The exhibition will provide an overview of Ronias' basic structure,
                            including social systems, geography, and ecosystems. I want to generate the experience of
                            walking through a museum chamber where one's social and global structure is visualized
                            through drawings and 3D models. I considered the concepts of "What if we're not the only
                            species with high intelligence?" and "Uniqueness is singularity but also extraordinary" when
                            I first started working on Ronias. I wanted to investigate deeply into the idea that every
                            person is unique in some way. Being unique might be viewed negatively in some cultures, but
                            there are times when it makes you stronger than everyone else."

                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                            Hoang Bao Ngan Tran (or Ngan Tran, also goes by Azure Fuzz on all social media), is a
                            digital media artist focusing on illustration and concept art. She was born and raised in
                            Vietnam before coming to the US to pursue an education in Digital Art in 2017. Ngan attended
                            Evergreen Valley College from 2017 to 2020 and received an AA in 2-D and Studio Art. In
                            2020, she transferred to San Jose State University in the midst of the pandemic as an
                            undergraduate Digital Media Art student.
                            <br><br>
                            Ngan sees the world as a story that only she can see and tell through her works. Her
                            abilities in various digital mediums give her a certain value of freedom in creating her own
                            work. She mostly expresses her contradictory worldview through various digital illustrations
                            and character design. Her favorite drawing applications are Procreate and Clip Studio Paint.
                            She also experiments with frame-by-frame animation using those two applications. With Adobe
                            Creative Clouds, Nganâ€™s experience with the apps is all on an intermediate level. However,
                            she has more works created using After Effects and Premier for all video editing projects.
                            Ngan is also interested in game design and concept design, with a variety of games created
                            using Twine, p5.js, and Unity. For 3D works, she also has experience in modeling in Blender
                            and creates virtual scenes in Mozilla hubs and Unity.
