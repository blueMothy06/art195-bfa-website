                            Artist statement: "The piece that I chose for my gallery, Labyrinth of Mind, is a looping
                            animation of a butterfly stuck in a spider web. In many traditions and beliefs, butterflies
                            are a symbol of change and transformation, the breaking point where a person gets out of
                            their hardship. On the other hand, spider webs would symbolize anything that one might get
                            stuck with and hard to get out of. It could be the past, it could be society beliefs, their
                            family’s expectation, or their own comfort zone. The looping animation represents a repeated
                            struggling situation. However, in this art piece, the butterfly is only hanged, and it is
                            actually capable of breaking free from the web on its own. Labyrinth of Mind stands for the
                            kind of melancholy and indecision that we tend to dwell into, and it is very hard for us to
                            get out of it on our own. In this short animation, because it is an open space that is
                            covered with webs and dust, the only main object is a dim glowing butterfly that’s on the
                            verge of giving up its life. I want this depressed scenario to never get resolved so that it
                            will last longer in our mind. When one reads the description of the piece and looks at this
                            whole scene, I hope it would make the audience think about themselves and their own
                            experience in a similar situation. The butterfly here may or may not get out of the spider
                            webs that cling onto it, but the audience can choose whether they want to step up and work
                            on their situation, or just leave it there never resolved."

                            Phuong Ngo was born in Bien Hoa, Vietnam, in 1995. She then moved to the USA in
                            late 2016, and pursuit her digital art career since then. She is currently majoring Digital
                            Media Art in SJSU, and planning to graduate this Fall 2023. During her time in school, she
                            learned html and java coding; so aside from digital drawing, Phuong can also do basic
                            website design, logo design, character design, and fashion design. She is a digital
                            illustrator that started making her earliest works mostly based on fan art and game art. In
                            2020, she changed her art style into semi-realism, increased her fanbase and started
                            accepting commissions as her second part-time job. She has a good storytelling skill, and
                            has talent in implying parable, lesson, wordplay, symbol, etc. in her artworks. Phuong
                            really tends to include a second layer meaning behind every detail of her work of art,
                            because she personally thinks that is how any artwork becomes a work of art - by being
                            meaningful in the most subtle way.
