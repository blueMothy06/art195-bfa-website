                                Artist statement: "This will be a film that is told within a first person perspective
                                narrative that mixes the elements of a documentary evoking emotion, with the key
                                concepts being the viewer not to just see just an art piece, but who the artist is
                                behind all the “pretty” work. This focuses on a sense of vulnerability, like a personal
                                expression of thoughts or rants, along with a method of self-therapy and learning
                                process to let go of things. This is because I held onto so much past negativity and
                                memories and never had a healthy source of output to let go of them, so I decided to use
                                art as my next method. This is my story and to ensure it's told in a clear manner across
                                several different frames I am hand crafting each element within a scene to play out like
                                my own personal TV show. Cartoons are a huge chunk of what made me an artist, as I used
                                it as a method of escape from my dark thoughts as a young child. However, this will not
                                be just a 2-d animated cartoon skit, but a layered story that mixes mediums involving
                                personal recordings and photographs, so that way the story is grounded and allows depth
                                within the telling of my story. The method of display will be done in a 3-d environment,
                                where the user is the camera and will walk within the room to observe the film projected
                                on the television. The reason for this is because we watch stories all the time through
                                sources of media and I wanted to implement that same experience, which is an element of
                                personal nostalgia, and is something most viewers have grown up doing within the last
                                few decades. Once the viewer has completed witnessing the film, the hoped outcome of it
                                should be that they know more about me, not just as an artist, but as a human being.
                                However, this is a very emotional piece and I truly don’t know what one will feel coming
                                out. We are all different, but share events labeled as “common”, so to say the viewer
                                will be emotional is fair, but it shouldn’t be of pity but rather that of understanding.
