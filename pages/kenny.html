                            Artist statement: "Your friend from school is hosting a Halloween party and invites many
                            other students, including all of your other friends. You, however, did not receive an
                            invitation. You tell yourself that he forgot to invite you but deep down, you know he did
                            not want to. Did he ever consider you as a friend? You feel extremely lonely from being
                            excluded and wonder if you will find true friends.
                            <br><br>
                            Similarly, in a zombie apocalypse, you would feel the same but on a grander scale. Instead
                            of a lack of friends, there is a lack of survivors. In a world overrun by zombies, the ratio
                            of zombies to survivors would be drastically high. In some adaptations, it can be as high as
                            5,000 to 1.
                            <br><br>
                            Lonesome Horizon evokes a strong sense of loneliness and isolation through the concept of an
                            apocalyptic city overrun by zombies. Immersed in a virtual environment with zombies
                            attacking the viewer with insults instead of bites and scratches, the viewer is vulnerable
                            and exiled from the community. In real life, the viewer may have felt lonely before â€”
                            Lonesome Horizon reminds them that they are indeed alone. However, the city is not
                            completely lost to the undead; there are many consoling resources advertised to the viewer.
                            Lonesome Horizon serves as an emotional reflection on isolation and echoes the struggle
                            against loneliness in both virtual and real-life landscapes, while offering a glimmer of
                            hope amidst so much desolation."
